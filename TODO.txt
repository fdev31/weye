- re-introduce keyboard navigation ?
- fix editor save
- buttons come from:
  - plugins (TBD)
  - mime's action (todo after refactor of Resource & Template factories)
- markdown editor ? special mime with actions ? :)
- make "editables" per mime type instead of per item
- allow some to override the save form mechanism (per mime type)
- real installer / setup packaging
- introduce plugins
    - unify/re-use code for applications/mimes/plugins
    - make "notes" a plugin (that comes with the markdown stuff)
